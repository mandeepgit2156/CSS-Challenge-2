                    I am 20 years old, studying Computer Programming from Georgian college. I was born and brought up in
                    Punjab (India) and moved to Canada for higher education after 12th. I studied Physics, Chemistry and
                    Maths in senior year. I am very inquisitive and firmly believes in learning new things everyday. I
                    love to read, write, run, do calisthenics, art and craft, watch shows, explore music, walking and
                    nature. I love participating in extra curricular activities since I was in school. I was national
                    level debater for three years and was awarded the best speaker for a year. Running helps me relax
                    myself, the form of activity which was just a help to me during my studies turned into passion and I
                    represented at the state level cross country. I am getting back to running since I came to Canada,
                    and has joined the 'Queer running club' which is a Toronto based running club. My first official
                    race will be the 'Pride and Remembrance Run' which is a fundraising run for many organizations. I
                    also love to explore new places, watch sunsets, enjoy me time at the beach, listen to music and
                    write.
